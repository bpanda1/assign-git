1.What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 

A gitignore file is the one which tells to ignore certain files, so temporary files like .class, .jar are not uploaded to git.
For a java project, .gitignore file contains temporary files like compiled class file (.class), package files like .jar, ,zip.

Example: A gitignore file created during when java project
# Compiled class file
*.class

# Log file
*.log

# BlueJ files
*.ctxt

# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
.mtj.tmp/

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar

2.What does fast-forward in Git mean?

Fast-forward is a type of merge done by git in a situation where git simply moves the HEAD pointer for that branch to the latest commit. 
It means lets say I created a testbranch from master branch, did some changes in testbranch and pushed the changes to the master branch. 
During this period nobody else has made any commit to the master branch, then git simply fast forwards the HEAD pointer from the last 
saved commit to the latest commit performed by me.

Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
Bijayalaxmis-MacBook-Pro:assign-git bijayalaxmipanda$ git branch
* master
  testbranch
  testbranch2
Bijayalaxmis-MacBook-Pro:assign-git bijayalaxmipanda$ git merge testbranch

3. Why should you have different branches?
There are various reasons for which it is an ideal practice to have different branches:
 - It will be feasible that everyone can work independently taking a snapshot from the main branch and then collaborate their changes without messing the main branch.
 - Due to the concept of multiple branch, testing also can be carried out simultaneously without breaking other's work.
 - As multiple people are working, it is easy to reach the project goal.
 - Different branches makes life easier for a developer, tester to manage and maintain the product as we can have multiple branches for various release of the same product.

4.In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Generally we have one Git repository in a project.
